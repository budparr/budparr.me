For me, understanding science and craft is a historical necessity. I was so ignorant for so long, producing mediocre images. I felt I needed to steep myself in this knowledge. Of course, I understand that this knowledge can't make you a great photographer, but I think it can make you a more thoughtful photographer, which I think leads to consistent good photographs.

That said, I think most books on craft are not very good.
