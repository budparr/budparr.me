— Alec Soth, _Somewhere To Disappear_

We ask a lot of photographs. They tell a story, express feelings, evoke a time or place, stoke memories, or sometimes merely mesmerize us. They do very much what literature does. I'd say a good photograph has qualities of a good poem. Their meaning is usually not handed to us without careful attention. They both thrive on structure and sing when not bound by structure. Neither typically take long to consume, but—at the risk of sounding corny—may take a while to absorb into your consciousness. At its best, a photograph doesn't tell us what to think, but allows us—demands of us—to bring our experiences to it to make meaning. I think this creates an uneasy relationship between words and photographs where words risk making explicit what should be left to the image.

Of course, words and images have always coexisted, yet, rarely in perfect symbiosis. This is what I long for; photobooks where the images and words feed one another.

I have a rather massive book called _Literature and Photography_ that anthologizes writings where photography is elemental in one way or another. I bought it on the title alone, thinking if I love literature and I love photography I'm bound to love this book. To be sure, there's lots of great work there, but it's, well, text-heavy.

Walker Evan's images are a fraction of James Agee's text in _Let Us Now Praise Famous Men_, yet, the images are critical to evoke the conditions the words describe.

The best example I've found so far—and one of my favorite photobooks—is _Human Archipelago_ with photographs by Fazal Sheik and text written or selected by Teju Cole. Rarely have I ever seen a more beautiful or more meaningful pairing of words and images.

Teju Cole also pairs his own images in [_Blind Spot_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/551542/blind-spot-by-teju-cole/) to great effect. Cole's images—which don't approach the beauty of those in _Human Archipelago_—exist only with the text; they are a diptych. Without being explicit, the text slows you down and forces you to confront the image. As Siri Hustvedt says in the forward "As I move through the book, I shuffle from concrete image to abstract thought."

In Todd Hido's dreadfully beautiful [_The End Sends Advanced Warning_](https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/the-end-sends-advance-warning), the use of text is spare, disciplined, with just two short poems in the entire book. So very powerful for their lack of company. Even Hido's dedication carries a lot of weight:

> This book is dedicated to Larry Sultan,
> who taught me that I could
> walk up to sentimentality
> but not become it

I recently watched the classic film "[Sunset Boulevard](https://letterboxd.com/film/sunset-boulevard/)," in which a star of the silent film era loses grip with reality mourning her former career. Norma Desmond is played by real life silent film star Gloria Swanson. What strikes you is the expressiveness of her face, which here is rather extreme compared to everyone else. Artists work within the constraints of their form; without the luxury of speaking, the best actors of the day used their eyes and mouth and hands to say what they couldn't express otherwise. I personally think the most spare art forms can be the most beautiful.
