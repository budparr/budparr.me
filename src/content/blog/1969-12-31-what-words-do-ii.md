> In every good photo there must be a mystery, something that cannot be explained...captions block people's interpretation of photographs.
> — Josef Koudelka

II: Captions

Many people believe that photographs should be presented without any helpful caption or interpretation and I agree, but I also crave it because so often a photograph's mystery opens questions

Captions can be a knowing marker, even if simply descriptive. Robert Adams' [_Los Angeles Spring_](https://steidl.de/Books/Los-Angeles-Spring-0135404859.html) simply labels each image with a place and a date. It doesn't take much to guess that where he was standing when this photograph was taken (see image) is nothing like what's there now. Given the tenor of the book, that's the point:

> Whether those trees stand are reassuring is a question for a lifetime. All that is clear is the perfection of what we were given, the unworthiness of our response, and the certainty, in view of our current deprivation that we are judged. (from the introduction)

I wouldn't say the meaning of the photograph is derived from its location, but I get a sense of warning in the simple beauty of open land here; later in the book, some of the captions are more descriptive about the fact that the land then was not what it once was.

Henri Cartier-Bresson said:

> I won't give explanations. My photographs are there; I do not comment on my photographs—I have nothing to say...what's wonderful in intuitive photography, it's that vital reaction, where you are yourself and at the same time forget yourself, so that you can question reality or try to understand.

In Josef Koudelka's [_Exiles_](https://aperture.org/books/exiles/) the captions are listed in the front so that the images stand on their own, and of course, that works. The images take on more than documentary value, they evoke a world that doesn't exist, one that almost never had. Words would be too much.

Yet, wouldn't it be nice, now, nearly 40 years later to know more context around his work?

[_The Making of Exiles_](https://exb.fr/en/catalogue/300-la-fabrique-d-exils-9782365111188.html) does just that with histories accompanied by graphics and contact sheets:

Spain, 1973: the passer-by, intrigued by a curious processional float with a female figure on it, was, if anything, in the way, as she walked round and round the object; and then suddenly, he provided the perfect foreground, his indifference totally out of tune with the background. Nothing in the surroundings enables you to understand the wold eyes, disproportionate face. What is explicit as you scan the contact sheets becomes hermetic in the isolated image.
