_A Journal of Photography and its Literature_

For a long time I didn’t take any pictures. What, I felt, is the value of a singular photograph against the waves of imagery washing over us every day? I fell prey to the idea that art isn’t worth making when everybody can be an _artist_ with a click and swipe. Yet, I came to realize that the value in creating is very much a matter of intention:

> “…the big distinction between good art and soso art lies somewhere in the art’s heart’s purpose, the agenda of the consciousness behind the text. It’s got something to do with love. With having the discipline to talk out of the part of yourself that [can love] instead of the part that just wants to too be loved.”

_— David Foster Wallace, as quoted in Tim Carpenter’s To Photograph is to Learn How to Die_

The enjoyment of photography and the deep seated need to create persist in me, so I decided to jump back in; head first.

My way of doing pretty much anything is through books. In my case, attending a program beyond the occasional workshop is currently out of the question. That's not to say that what is here is an end, but a jumping off point for many personal challenges out in the world with a camera—or here at home with a makeshift studio and darkroom.

I first revisited some books I’ve loved in the past, such as Bruce Barnbaum’s _The Art of Photography: A Personal Approach to Artistic Expression_, and began to look around for what was out there. I felt I wanted to go beyond merely reading about technique and think about what photography means, how it fits in the world and how it’s used. I wanted to understand some of the science behind the gear I obsess over. I also wanted to understand what makes a particular photograph art.

At first, it seemed as though there was very little beyond the usual suspects (Sontag, Barthes), but living in New York City, I began to find a rich field of literature in bookstores on or related to photography, so here I will share my findings on books I found valuable and illuminate the best of them as best I can.

### This site is organized along the following lines:

- Art & Appreciation
- History
- Science & Craft (Technique)
- Theory & Philosophy (Thought)

I'm sure there could be much overlap within these groupings, but for the sake of simplicity, four broad categories should do. I'll probably have more to say in the journal section of the site, but I think its worth outlining the rich world of books worth reading.

A note on the name:

When I first saw the Mathematical formula for depth of field, I was delighted to find a value for the “circle of confusion.” I thought it was a joke about the difficulty in pinning down DOF, yet there it is!
![{\displaystyle {\text{DOF}}\approx {\frac {2u^{2}Nc}{f^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/187d5ad538cee7781bf148b2226c86317b83cd31)
[_Source wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field)

Optically speaking, the “circle of confusion” (a fixed number, _c_ in the equation above) is a “spot caused by a cone of light rays from a lens _not_ coming to a perfect focus when imaging a point source.”

Figuratively speaking, its the feeling one gets trying to understand the vast world of photography (well, anything complex, for that matter). We search for clarity in what seems simple, yet the deeper we go into the topic, we realize that knowing is unattainable.

TO PHOTOGRAPH IS TO LEARN HOW TO DIE - The Ice Plant

Tim Carpenter’s book-length essay often feels lit from within — thanks to his own insights sagely illuminated by gems from his fellow photographers, poets, musicians, painters, curators, and others. I keep the book on my bedside table near the poems of Emily Dickinson and Tomas Tranströmer, for those sleepless nights when a little light — …
