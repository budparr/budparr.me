For all the books on craft and other topics I've read, just looking at photographs has influenced me the most. Passively looking at images can only go so far, but actively thinking about what someone is trying to say with their work and how they approached it will inform your own work profoundly. For me that means starts with 'how can I make work like this,' which manifests in trying new approaches, hopefully in the end helping me define my own style.

I'm still at the stage where I'm trying a lot of different styles or genre of photography, so I'm looking at a lot of portraiture, documentary, street, architectural, abstract, still life and landscape. Of those, portraiture and documentary are where my heart is, though I suspect being a non-professional means that I tend toward some conglomeration of all of the above, as long as it's enjoyable.
