I grew up shooting film when that’s all there was. However, without a darkroom of my own, I was missing . So you could say, not serious. I jumped to digital easily and went through several cameras until full-frame came within reach. This seemed to me some sort of parity with the film I had given up. Finally, I had full control over the process! I thought I was happy.

A few years ago I began this journey of pushing my abilities to take photography seriously as a craft and art form.

If you travel around YouTube you may know that Fujifilm cameras are often mentioned in the same breath as film emulations. Fujifilm didn’t start that fire, but they‘ve mastered creating digital-based characteristics of their erstwhile film stocks, and they are brilliant. I particularly loved Acros, a monochrome simulation, and while I never shoot JPEGs, I used the Acros profile in Lightroom and stayed as close to original, using the idea of do-in-digital-what-I-could-do-in-film as my guideline, often adding a bit of grain though to fit my aesthetic.

Grain is funny, because it’s a technological artifact; it’s noise whether in digital or film, but I think most of us find it aesthetically appealing. While film grain‘s appeal comes from its natural randomness, digital noise on some cameras actually looks pretty good, and editing software does a good of replicating film. I also loved the Nik Collection long before it got bought by DxO, makers of DxO PhotoLab and—notably for our discussion—DxO FilmPack, which “bring[s] back the timeless magic of film.”

Let’s fast-forward a bit. Becoming frustrated with Fujifilm’s not-quite rangefinder and still had a bug in my brain about full-frame sensors, I finally decided to sell every piece of photographic equipment I owned to buy a used Leica M11. The M11 has one of the best sensors of any camera, both in my experience and in its quantitative scoring at [DXOMark](https://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/Leica/M11) and [Photons to Photos](https://www.photonstophotos.net/Charts/PDR.htm#Hasselblad%20X2D-100c,Leica%20M11), matching closely to medium-format sensors. The camera really is beautiful. To my mind, the Leica M cameras are pure fully-manual perfection down to every detail, and the images are so full and detailed. It’s astonishing, really.

So, perfection! Right?

_Now let’s pause for a moment to make clear this discussion is about my journey. I’m an amateur photographer trying to take my work seriously, but I’m not shooting magazine covers or breaking news or Architectural Digest spreads or annual reports or even trying to make a name on social media. No judgements on the work of others._

Around the same time, Lightroom began to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) into their software. Lightroom and most of the others are quite sophisticated already with very precise masking capabilities, long offering a universe of manipulation tools. Even then, using the masking tool to select a sky or a person’s face, I was amazed, but also frustrated by how close, yet not quite perfect they were. Almost an uncanny valley of perfection. Then [AI](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/04/18/new-adobe-lightroom-ai-innovations-empower-everyone-edit-like-pro) came to town.

### When you can do anything, nothing is worth doing.

You’ve heard there’s an unspoken rule that serious photographers only edit as much as necessary. Besides, we can see, for example, when those skies look more like something in a Christopher Nolan movie than anything we’ve ever seen in real life. AI changes everything. AI makes everything perfect, if we want it, and beyond the realm of being easily detectable.

The Content Authenticity Initiative by Adobe and a bunch of other major players in the industry will solve this kinda sorta by giving us some verifiable traceability on images. I’m all for it, particularly for journalism. Trust but verify, someone once said.

At any rate, I’m not sure how much skill it takes to make _great_ images with AI, but I’m going to guess that the bar is low. I’ve seen amazing applications of AI, but if I merely loved photography for the final image, perhaps I’d be more content just looking at other people’s images. I love photography for the process - I love the gear, I love the thought behind making images and I love trying (and never achieving) that hole-in-one shot.

> "_I have often thought that if photography were difficult in the true sense of the term -meaning that the creation of a simple photograph would entail as much time and effort as the production of a good watercolor or etching - there would be a vast improvement in total output. The sheer ease with which we can produce a superficial image often leads to creative disaster"._

Perhaps I’m easily influenced. I drank vodka for an entire year after reading an interview with Boris Pasternak. You can’t unsee videos on YouTube. The algorithm takes you by the hand and leads you down the path no matter how niche. Truth is, I never found any of the videos on ‘Why you should/Should you‘ shoot film very convincing. I think that’s because there are no good arguments for shooting film. For me, it felt more like an inevitability. I tell myself it’s because I’m searching for authenticity, but that projects a false judgment on digital.

Sheilds vs Burtynsky

It's not so much that I want it to be hard, but I don't want to it to be too easy either. I want the _artisticness_ to come from me, as close to my eye as possible and at the least having to decide BEFORE I click the shutter leaves all those decisions to my brain and my eye.
